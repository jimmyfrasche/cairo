//Package cairo wraps libcairo, a 2D graphics library with support for multiple
//output devices.
//Libcairo is is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
//while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available.
//
//The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators
//of PostScript and PDF.
//Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines,
//transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text
//rendering.
//All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation
//(scale, rotation, shear, etc.)
//
//Naming Conventions
//
//Cairo refers to this package and its related packages.
//Libcairo refers to the C library that this package is a binding to.
//
//Libcairo version
//
//This package requires libcairo version 1.12 or greater.
//Libcairo must be compiled with:
//	CAIRO_HAS_PNG_FUNCTIONS
//	CAIRO_HAS_IMAGE_SURFACE
//
//Related packages, such as cairo/ps, may require further options compiled
//in to libcairo, but they will be documented.
//
//Libcairo can be found at http://cairographics.org .
//
//Xtensions
//
//Many types, functions, and methods are prefixed by Xtension.
//You may ignore these unless you are writing an extension.
//An extension is a package that integrates another portion of libcairo or
//binds with a library that supports libcairo integration.
